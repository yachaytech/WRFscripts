This directory holds the sectors that can be used.

As an example:
ANDES_00  ANDES_01  ANDES_02  ANDES_03  ANDES_04  ANDES_05  ANDES_06  ICELAND  README.txt

Inside each directory:
wps wrf

These directories are where the WRF runs store the needed daily data. Briefly, the namelist files are automatically updated for the run date. The namelist files are where the WRF parameters are defined. Also, the domains are defined here.

TODO: there is a lot going here, to be updated.
links are made back to WRF and WPS directory to needed programs and data
